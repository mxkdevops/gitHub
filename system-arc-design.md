### üß† 1. MINDSET ‚Äî What‚Äôs your app‚Äôs relationship with Linux?
Ask yourself:
```bash
Question	Example Answer
Who runs my app?	A systemd service? CLI tool? Web UI?
How does it communicate?	Sockets? HTTP? Filesystem?
Does it need to run continuously?	Yes (like a daemon) or just on-demand
Does it listen on a port?	Yes ‚Üí need to bind, maybe drop privileges
What kind of logs/data do I generate?	Need a directory, logrotate?
Do I schedule tasks or run 24/7?	cron jobs or service?
Do I need root? Or can I be a user process?	Safer is non-root unless absolutely needed
```

### üèóÔ∏è 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DESIGN (Like Apache Did)

- Build using the OS features instead of fighting them:
- Layer	Your Design Questions
- System	Use systemd or custom init?
- Ports/Network	Need to bind? Use reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx)?
- Users/Permissions	Drop privileges after startup?
- Logging	stdout? File-based? syslog integration?
- Config Files	Use /etc/myapp/config.yaml? Env vars?
- Data Storage	Do I write to /var/lib/myapp/ or /tmp/?
- Logs	Use /var/log/myapp/?
- Monitoring	Provide health endpoint? Metrics?

###  üß© 3. MINIMAL SET TO BUILD A BASIC APP (like a tiny web server)
üß™ First working prototype:
- Component	Tools/Tech
- Language	Python, Go, Rust, or C
- Listening on port	socket library, or framework like Flask/FastAPI
- Serve response	HTML, JSON
- Logging	To file or stdout, structured logs
- Config	.env, yaml, CLI flags
- Launch	Manually first, then via systemd
- Backup/Storage	Write files to /var/lib/myapp/

###  üß≠ Summary ‚Äî First Things to Think About
When building a system-level app like a web server:

First Think About	Why It Matters
OS constraints	Permissions, ports, logs, filesystems
Runtime mode	Daemon? CLI tool? Triggered by cron?
Communication	API? Socket? Port? Shared file?
Logging & error handling	Users will need to debug you
Privileges & security	Drop root if possible
File layout	Follow Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
